With it's attack stat of 300, it can function as the best Psychic type Pokemon, a good generalist, a ghost type attacker and even as a ice, electric and fire type attacker!","desc_moves":"Firstly the quick moves, if you want to use Mewtwo as a Psychic type attacker use Confusion. If you want use Mewtwo for anything else, use Psycho cut. Now the charge moves:\nPsychic should be paired with Confusion to make Mewtwo the best Psychic type attacker.\nShadow Ball should be paired with Psycho cut to make Mewtwo a hard hitter against other Psychic types, e.g other Mewtwo, Lugia, Deoxys. This is the best moveset for Mewtwo but is also legacy.\nIce Beam can be paired with Psycho cut for one of the best ice type attackers in the game. Only Mamoswine, Weavile and Glaceon are ahead of it. If you want a unique team of ice attackers, Mewtwo is a perfectly acceptable option.\nThunderbolt make Mewtwo a fairly good electric type attacker though it is outclassed by the like Raikou, Zapdos and Electivire. It is still decent in this role.\nFlamethrower make Mewtwo an ok fire type attacker, though Pokemon like Moltres, Entei and Charizard outclass it.\nFocus Blast is good for all those gyms against Blissey and Snorlax but Pokemon like Machamp and Hariyama can probably do better.\nHyper Beam is Mewtwo's worst move and should be TM away. Note Hyper Beam is legacy.","desc_pvp":"Mewtwo hits a lot of the meta very hard. It gets wins over almost anything that it does not have a type disadvantage against. The moveset you will want is going to be Psycho cut/Shadow Ball (legacy)/ and ice beam. If you don't have shadow ball, any move aside from Hyper Beam or Psychic is still very viable. Mewtwo should only be used in the Master League. Depending on its moveset it can win against a good amount of opponents. In fact the only meta relevant Pokemon in the Master league that always wins against Mewtwo is Tyranitar. Mewtwo is quite a safe option in the Master league and can definitely be at least considerable.","pve_rate":"5","pvp_rate":"4","trainer":"UnkemptBeast","lvl":"40"},{"desc_meta":"The best current psychic attacker and in the top 3 Shadow Ball users. Can hold its ground as an Ice or Electric sub-in during raids. Mewtwo is also the ONLY viable Bolt-Beam generalist and a great ghost/fighting generalist, far surpassing other generalists by virtue of covering everything in the game for neutral or SE damage (except the Magnemite family for bolt-beam), at least until Abilities are introduced.","desc_moves":"Psycho cut is generally preferred as it allows faster Charge Move launching and better dodging window in PVE. Confusion is useful only when shooting for neutral or Psychic-type damage. Shadow Ball + Focus Blast: Not resisted by any Pokemon, useful vs Ghosts and Psychics;  Ice Beam + Thunderbolt: Only resisted by Magnezone, useful vs Dragons, and generally fires faster than Shadow Ball + Focus Blast moveset.","desc_pvp":"One of the best in Ultra league due to high stats and impressively diverse movepool. However, Giratina and other Ghost or Dark Pokemon with more bulk can often become a barrier without the right moveset.","pve_rate":"5","pvp_rate":"4","trainer":"DrDro93","lvl":"39"},{"desc_meta":"The #1 meta relevant Pokemon. Mewtwo is very versatile and has powerful Psychic, Ice, Fire, Electric, Fighting and Ghost moves. It will be able to Mega Evolve in the near future.

With both fast moves being Psychic (Confusion and Psycho Cut) and having a long list of incredible Charged moves to make it great (legacy Shadow Ball and Ice Beam stand out) there’s also STAB Psychic, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt and Flamethrower to give it a cutting edge on whatever you can throw in its path.","desc_pvp":"From what I’ve seen, it functions the same as it usually does in PvE when compared to PvP, still being a notable threat.","pve_rate":"5","pvp_rate":"5","trainer":"MattasticVGC","lvl":"40"},{"desc_meta":"Mewtwo is the best Psychic type and Also a Meta Relevant Pokemon\nit was released through Ex-Raids at first then after that in 2018 for the Bonus Challenge it was released as a Tier 5 Raid Boss, but its best charge move Shadow Ball was a Legacy move and people had to use Tm's before it was released.\nin terms of DPS it is the best attacker and very helpful for Defeating Raid Bosses like Machamp and other Dark type pokemon.\nin PVP it is very useful .","desc_moves":"Confusion-the best Psychic fast attack\nShadow Ball-the best Ghost type Charge attack","desc_pvp":"if doing Master League should have atleast one Mewtwo in deck as it helps defeating variety of pokemons.","pve_rate":"5","pvp_rate":"5","trainer":"Firsttimefever","lvl":"40"},{"desc_meta":"This pokémon is superb in the meta.
