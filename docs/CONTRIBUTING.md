# Contributing

## Creating the Pull Request
To contribute, fork the project on GitHub, then submit a pull request to the master branch.

## How to write code?
The project is written in Kotlin JS ([Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) that is compiled to javascript) and React framework.
A good tutorial for the two can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-react.html).
You should be able to use any IDE which supports Kotlin. I recommend [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

## How to run the project locally
Running `./gradlew browserDevelopmentRun` should do the trick. You can run it from terminal or from IDEA.

## It doesn't work / I don't know how to do something
If there is a problem that this documentation nor [FAQ](./FAQ.md) clarifies, 
feel free to reach me via creating [an issue on github](https://github.com/rybick/pogolitics/issues).
